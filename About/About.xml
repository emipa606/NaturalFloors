Adds buildable natural floors. A well can be placed near a natural water source (no water no well sorry) to collect water at the cost of some wood (for the bucket...) to allow you to lay water terrain, a compost bin can take foods and corspes and will turn them into compost over time (careful with your food, pawns will keep bringing it) compost allows you to lay soil, gravel etc, sand can be got from chunks at the stoneworking bench to allow you to lay sand. Normal stone blocks can be used to create the natural tone rock terrain as well.
